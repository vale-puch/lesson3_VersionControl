            </h2>
            <p class="lead">
Version control helps make file sharing easier and is the main repository for all the files of the project being worked on. Version control allows all project members to look at files, make any necessary changes to them, then commit/check them back in. A version control system (VCS for short) has the ability to automatically note who changed the files, when they were changed, and what specific changes were made. A a VCS merges all the changes made into the same file and give users the ability to revert back to an older version of their project(s) if necessary. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">One of the most popular version control systems out there is called GIT. It is a free, open source VCS that is capable of handling projects of all sizes in a quick and efficient manner. There are many reason why GIT is such a popular version control system. Since it is a local repository, GIT allows its users to work offline. GIT is also a distributed version control system. This means that every user has access to all the repository data stored locally on their PCs. That makes it incredibly convenient for teams of people to contribute to their respective projects. Finally, there is no need to fear accidental overwrites of files when using GIT because it is specifically designed to prevent this, no matter how many changes are made to a single or multiple files.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The majority of GIT repositories are hosted on a site called GitHub. Millions of developers have accounts on GitHub and use it to collaborate on projects big and small. A lot of open source projects like to use GitHub for Git hosting, issue tracking, and code review, to name a few reasons. So although GitHub is not directly part of the GIT open source project, the odds are that any person who wants to use GIT in their professional lives will need to interact/ become familiar with GitHub eventually. Anyone can set up a GitHub account following a series of simple steps that will be described down below.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Before becoming familiar with GitHub, it is necessary to make an account. In order to create an account, you must have an email address, a unique username, and a password. The password you pick must contain at least one lowercase letter, one numeral, and seven characters. GitHub requires this in order to ensure that nobody can easily guess your password and hack your account. Once you've completed those steps, you press the button that says "Sign up for GitHub"- it's big and green, so it's practically impossible to miss. Afterwards, you will then be directed to a page that lists upgraded plans. You can skip this step and move on to the next step, which is verifying the email address that you used to make you GitHub account. You can do this by checking your inbox and clicking on the confirmation email sent by GitHub. Once you've confirmed you email address, you can head back to the GitHub website and click on the Octocat logo at the top-left of the screen. Doing so will take you to your dashboard and boom; you're ready to start exploring GitHub!</p>

                <span class="text-muted">How Do You Get a GIT Repository?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GIT is fairly easy to pick up on once you've become familiar and comfortable with some of its basic commands. These commands allow you to configure and initialize a repository, begin and stop tracking files, and stage and commit changes. There are two main ways of going about acquiring a GIT project. The first approach involves taking an existing project or directory and importing into GIT, while the second duplicates an existing GIT repository from a different server. To initialize a repository in an existing server, you must go to the project's directory type 'git init' after the dollar sign ($). As a result, you should now have a new subdirectory named .git which contains all of the repository files that you'll need. In other words, it's a GIT repository skeleton. If you would like to start version-controlling files that already exist, you would then proceed to begin tracking those files by doing an initial commit. You would go about this by typing 'git add *.c' followed by 'git add LICENSE' and 'git commit -m 'initial project version' '. After implementing those commands, you should have a GIT repository with tracked files and an initial commit. If you would prefer to clone a GIT repository you would need to execute the 'git clone' command. The way you use this command is by typing 'git clone [url]'. Once you enter your desired URL and it goes through successfully, a new directory should be created, initializing a .git directory inside it and pulling down all the data for that repository while checking out a fully-functioning copy of the latest version. Once you enter your new directory, you should be able to access the project files in there.</p>
